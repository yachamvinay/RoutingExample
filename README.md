The Project is sample example for Routing in angular. Here I have used json in order to fetch the data and I also used the authentication i.e. JWT Token using this the login form will works and actaully its a dummy Token which I have taken a reference from internet.

#In order to run
first run json server

If you don't have the JSON server you need to install it first using below command in terminal


--> npm install -g json-server


And I have created a JSON file as data.json where I will all the data in there
In order to run it use the command


--> json-server --watch data.json


After running the coomand in terminal it will show like this
